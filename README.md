# üìò NLP Project: Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Fine Food Dataset Reviews

## üìå Project Overview
This project focuses on **Sentiment Analysis** using the **Amazon Fine Food Reviews Dataset**. Sentiment analysis is a crucial aspect of business intelligence, enabling companies to refine their strategies based on customer opinions. **NLP (Natural Language Processing)** is a fundamental part of AI, and sentiment analysis is one of its most well-known applications.

The aim of this project is to classify user reviews into **three sentiment categories: Positive, Neutral, and Negative**. We explored various architectures, starting from **classical Machine Learning (ML) algorithms** and gradually increasing complexity by experimenting with **Deep Learning (DL) architectures**.

One of the key challenges in this dataset is **class imbalance**, as the reviews are skewed towards the positive class. This imbalance can impact the model's ability to correctly classify Neutral and Negative sentiments. To address this, we implemented **two approaches**:
1. **Testing complex deep learning architectures** while ensuring computational efficiency for real-world deployment.
2. **Oversampling (Random Over-Sampling)** to balance the dataset and improve classification performance.

Since the dataset is highly imbalanced, we primarily rely on **Precision, Recall, and F1-score** for evaluation, as accuracy alone is not informative in this scenario.

## üöÄ Implementation Steps

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - **Text Cleaning**: We cleaned the text by removing stopwords, punctuation, and converting everything to lowercase.
   - **Tokenization & Lemmatization**: The text was split into individual tokens (words), and each token was reduced to its base form using lemmatization.
   - **Feature Extraction**:
     - **TF-IDF with Bigrams**: We used **TF-IDF** to convert text data into numerical features. **Bigrams** (pairs of consecutive words) were used to capture more context in the data, which is beneficial for understanding sentiment.
     - **GloVe Embeddings**: We used **GloVe** word embeddings (50-dimensional vectors) with a **vocabulary size of 10,000 words**. GloVe allows the model to understand word meanings more efficiently in a low-dimensional space.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - **Sentiment Distribution**: We analyzed how the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) is distributed across the dataset.
   - **Statistical Insights**: We explored key statistics such as average review length and frequent words to better understand the nature of the dataset.

### 3. **Model Training & Evaluation**
   - **Applied Models on Both Original and Oversampled Datasets**:
     - **CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)**: Used to capture important features in the text and identify patterns that contribute to sentiment.
     - **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: Employed to capture the sequential dependencies and long-term relationships in the text data.
     - **Bi-directional LSTM**: A Bi-directional LSTM was used to process the text in both forward and backward directions, providing better context for sentiment prediction.
     - **LSTM + CNN Hybrid Architecture**: A hybrid model that combines the strengths of both LSTM and CNN to better capture sequential dependencies and important features.
   - **Performance Evaluation**: Models were evaluated based on **accuracy**, **F1-score**, and **CPU time** to ensure the models are not only accurate but also efficient for real-world applications.
